# Connect-4 Reference Implementation
This repository holds the metadata for the Connect-4 Reference Implementation which serves as the basis for continued education.

In providing continued education, it is aimed that this reference implementation be modified to suit the purpose. For example, in the case of teaching Maven, then the students would be required to add the required build files and the reference implementation to contain dependencies.

The reference implementation is designed to be modular, such that any module can be replaced by a new implementation for a specific topic of education. For example, a GUI module may be implemented in Swing, but can be replaced by one implemented in YMER.

Connect-4 is a distributed Client/Server system, to implement the game of Connect-4 (see: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connect4)
