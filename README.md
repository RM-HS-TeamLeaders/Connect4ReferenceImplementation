# Connect-4 Reference Implementation
This repository holds the metadata for the Connect-4 Reference Implementation

Connect 4 - Task Overview

The aim of this task is to create a digital version of the Connect 4 game (Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)

You will implement a completely autonomous system whereby two bots will play Connect4 against each other.

There are three major components to be implemented:

2x Players
1x Server

Each team will implement one of these components.

The description of this task is deliberately left vague, and therefore it is up to the teams to define the full scope of the task, which is one of the goals.

The task is split into four phases:

Phase 1: Definition of task/scope
Phase 2: Definition of API
Phase 3: Implementation
Phase 4: Demo & Retrospective

A hard time limit of 4 hours is provided for Phases 1 & 2 - that is, 4 hours after commencing, the core API should be defined.

Before Phase 2 is begun, the API should be adequately documented such that *any* person (even not related to the team) could code a client, independent of the server implementation and be able to play. A sample API document is included in this repository, and you should include your API document in this repository. Writing the API document does not count toward the 4 hour time limit.

Repositories have been created for each component and you should work collaboratively towards these Git repostitories.

This Task aims is designed to teach

* End-to-End Software Engineering principles
* Collabarative Software Development
* Team Building & Communication
* Git
